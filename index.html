    <p>Love starts as a feeling, but 
    to continue is a choice. And I 
    find myself choosing you, 
    more and more every day." â€”

    <p>HINATA</p>
    <p>Hinata Hyuuga from Naruto went through an amazing transformation in Naruto. 
        She went from being a supporting character with no confidence and a simple 
        crush to one of the strongest kunoichi in the Village of the Hidden Leaves. 
        She even fulfilled her unrequited love and broke free from the restrains the 
        Hyuuga Clan placed on her from a young age.</p>
